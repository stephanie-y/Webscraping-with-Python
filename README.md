Webscraping Texas' Death Row Information

Being from New York, I was surprised that capital punishment was only abolished in 21 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
I won't get into whether or not I agree with it but I thought it would be interesting to see some of the statistics behind it in Texas.
This is also my first time webscraping (my only knowledge of HTML is when MySpace was still popular) so I'm still learning as I go!
